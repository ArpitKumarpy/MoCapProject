**WELCOME TO STICK FRAMES**

**Description**:- To create a program that would track the body movements of a human and map it into a skeleton rig, that then can be used for various purposes, using just a camera.

**Prerequisites**:
•	Libraries such as Opencv, Mediapipe, CV zone<br>
•	Gaming engine like Unity<br>
•	GUI using Tkinter<br>

**Methodology**:- The methodology used here is to use Computer Vision to enable the computer to read the video inputs from camera of the by uploading video file from the storage of the device manually, and Game development  in Unity3D to integrate the 3D animation with the Computer Vision.

**Problem Tackled**:- Motion Capturing techniques demand a lot of capital and resources in form of ‘MO-CAP’ suits, and heavy grade equipment, that beginner enthusiasts can not afford plus they are too complicated to use.

**STEPS TO FOLLOW**
~Install UnityHub.<br>
~Download the Unity project file from **MotionCaptureUnity**.<br>
~Install the requires version of Unity according to the project<br>
~open the project<br>
~Run GUI.py<br>
~Select the type of input<br>
~Press 's' to stop tracking<br>
~go to unity project and run the project to see the motion captured.<br>
